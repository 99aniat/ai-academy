Dear A2A Energia,

This is Andrea Fontana, born in Brescia on 02/03/1991, currently living at Via San Faustino 45, 25122 Brescia.

I am writing to report an overcharge on my latest electricity bill, invoice number INV-9987453 dated May 31, 2025. The amount debited (EUR 342.80) is inconsistent with my average consumption.

My customer code is CUS2039487, tax code FNTNDR91C03B157X, and the account used for direct debit is IT76N0760105138254310034567.

I await clarification and a possible refund.

Kind regards,  
Andrea Fontana
